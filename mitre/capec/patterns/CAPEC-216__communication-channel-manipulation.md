# CAPEC-216 - Communication Channel Manipulation

**Abstraction:** Meta  -  **Likelihood:** n/a  -  **Severity:** n/a  -  **CAPEC:** [CAPEC-216](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/216.html)

## Description
An adversary manipulates a setting or parameter on communications channel in order to compromise its security. This can result in information exposure, insertion/removal of information from the communications stream, and/or potentially system compromise.

## Prerequisites
- The target application must leverage an open communications channel.
- The channel on which the target communicates must be vulnerable to interception (e.g., adversary in the middle attack - CAPEC-94).

## Resources required
- A tool that is capable of viewing network traffic and generating custom inputs to be used in the attack.

## Consequences
- **Confidentiality**: Read Data (A successful Communication Channel Manipulation attack can result in sensitive information exposure to the adversary, thereby compromising the communication channel's confidentiality.)
- **Integrity**: Read Data (The adversary's injection of additional content into a communication channel negatively impacts the integrity of that channel.), Modify Data (The adversary's injection of additional content into a communication channel negatively impacts the integrity of that channel.), Other (The adversary's injection of additional content into a communication channel negatively impacts the integrity of that channel.)

## Mitigations
- Encrypt all sensitive communications using properly-configured cryptography.
- Design the communication system such that it associates proper authentication/authorization with each channel/message.
