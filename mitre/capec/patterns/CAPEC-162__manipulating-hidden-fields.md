# CAPEC-162 - Manipulating Hidden Fields

**Abstraction:** Detailed  -  **Likelihood:** n/a  -  **Severity:** High  -  **CAPEC:** [CAPEC-162](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/162.html)

## Description
An adversary exploits a weakness in the server's trust of client-side processing by modifying data on the client-side, such as price information, and then submitting this data to the server, which processes the modified data. For example, eShoplifting is a data manipulation attack against an on-line merchant during a purchasing transaction. The manipulation of price, discount or quantity fields in the transaction message allows the adversary to acquire items at a lower cost than the merchant intended. The adversary performs a normal purchasing transaction but edits hidden fields within the HTML form response that store price or other information to give themselves a better deal. The merchant then uses the modified pricing information in calculating the cost of the selected items.

## Prerequisites
- The targeted site must contain hidden fields to be modified.
- The targeted site must not validate the hidden fields with backend processing.

## Resources required
- The adversary must have the ability to modify hidden fields by editing the HTTP response to the server.

## Execution flow
Execution Flow Explore Probe target web application: The adversary first probes the target web application to find all possible pages that can be visited on the website. Techniques Use a spidering tool to follow and record all links Use a proxy tool to record all links visited during a manual traversal of the web application. Find hidden fields: Once the web application has been traversed, the adversary looks for all hidden HTML fields present in the client-side. Techniques Use the inspect tool on all modern browsers and filter for the keyword "hidden" Specifically look for hidden fields inside form elements. Experiment Send modified hidden fields to server-side: Once the adversary has found hidden fields in the client-side, they will modify the values of these hidden fields one by one and then interact with the web application so that this data is sent to the server-side. The adversary observes the response from the server to determine if the values of each hidden field are being validated. Exploit Manipulate hidden fields: Once the adversary has determined which hidden fields are not being validated by the server, they will manipulate them to change the normal behavior of the web application in a way that benefits the adversary. Techniques Manipulate a hidden field inside a form element and then submit the form so that the manipulated data is sent to the server.
