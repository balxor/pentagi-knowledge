# CWE-1395 - Dependency on Vulnerable Third-Party Component

**Abstraction:** Class  -  **Status:** Incomplete  -  **CWE:** [CWE-1395](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1395.html)

## Description
The product has a dependency on a third-party component that contains one or more known vulnerabilities.

## Extended description
Many products are large enough or complex enough that part of their functionality uses libraries, modules, or other intellectual property developed by third parties who are not the product creator. For example, even an entire operating system might be from a third-party supplier in some hardware products. Whether open or closed source, these components may contain publicly known vulnerabilities or hidden functionality such as malware that could be exploited by adversaries to compromise the product.

## Applicable platforms / languages
Not Language-Specific, Not OS-Specific, Not Architecture-Specific, Not Technology-Specific

## Common consequences
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability**: Varies by Context

## Potential mitigations
- **Requirements, Policy**: In some industries such as healthcare [REF-1320] [REF-1322] or technologies such as the cloud [REF-1321], it might be unclear about who is responsible for applying patches for third-party vulnerabilities: the vendor, the operator/customer, or a separate service. Clarifying roles and responsibilities can be important to minimize confusion or unnecessary delay when third-party vulnerabilities are disclosed.
- **Requirements**: Require a Bill of Materials for all components and sub-components of the product. For software, require a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) [REF-1247] [REF-1311].
- **Architecture and Design, Implementation, Integration, Manufacturing**: Maintain a Bill of Materials for all components and sub-components of the product. For software, maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). According to [REF-1247], "An SBOM is a formal, machine-readable inventory of software components and dependencies, information about those components, and their hierarchical relationships."
- **Operation, Patching and Maintenance**: Actively monitor when a third-party component vendor announces vulnerability patches; fix the third-party component as soon as possible; and make it easy for operators/customers to obtain and apply the patch.
- **Operation, Patching and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor changes in each of the product's components, especially when the changes indicate new vulnerabilities, end-of-life (EOL) plans, etc.

## Related weaknesses
- CWE-1357 (ChildOf)
- CWE-657 (ChildOf)

## Observed examples (CVE)
- **CVE-2025-45612**: product uses a vulnerable version of an authentication framework, allowing authentication bypass
