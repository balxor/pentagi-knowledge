# CWE-578 - EJB Bad Practices: Use of Class Loader

**Abstraction:** Variant  -  **Status:** Draft  -  **CWE:** [CWE-578](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/578.html)

## Description
The product violates the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification by using the class loader.

## Extended description
The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container. In this case, the product violates the following EJB guideline: "The enterprise bean must not attempt to create a class loader; obtain the current class loader; set the context class loader; set security manager; create a new security manager; stop the JVM; or change the input, output, and error streams." The specification justifies this requirement in the following way: "These functions are reserved for the EJB container. Allowing the enterprise bean to use these functions could compromise security and decrease the container's ability to properly manage the runtime environment."

## Applicable platforms / languages
Java

## Common consequences
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Other**: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands, Varies by Context

## Potential mitigations
- **Architecture and Design, Implementation**: Do not use the Class Loader when writing EJBs.

## Related weaknesses
- CWE-573 (ChildOf)
