# CWE-76 - Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements

**Abstraction:** Base  -  **Status:** Draft  -  **CWE:** [CWE-76](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/76.html)

## Description
The product correctly neutralizes certain special elements, but it improperly neutralizes equivalent special elements.

## Extended description
The product may have a fixed list of special characters it believes is complete. However, there may be alternate encodings, or representations that also have the same meaning. For example, the product may filter out a leading slash (/) to prevent absolute path names, but does not account for a tilde (~) followed by a user name, which on some *nix systems could be expanded to an absolute pathname. Alternately, the product might filter a dangerous "-e" command-line switch when calling an external program, but it might not account for "--exec" or other switches that have the same semantics.

## Applicable platforms / languages
Not Language-Specific

## Common consequences
- **Other**: Other

## Potential mitigations
- **Requirements**: Programming languages and supporting technologies might be chosen which are not subject to these issues.
- **Implementation**: Utilize an appropriate mix of allowlist and denylist parsing to filter equivalent special element syntax from all input.

## Related weaknesses
- CWE-75 (ChildOf)
