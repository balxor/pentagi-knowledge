# T1632 - Subvert Trust Controls

**Tactic(s):** Defense Evasion  -  **Platforms:** Android, iOS  -  **ATT&CK:** [T1632](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1632)

## Summary
Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted applications. Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs or websites as possessing some level of trust. Examples of such features include: an app being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code signing certificate; an OS prompt alerting the user that an app came from an untrusted source; or getting an indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site. The method adversaries use will depend on the specific mechanism they seek to subvert.

## Role in the attack flow
Used to achieve the **Defense Evasion** objective. An autonomous agent invokes this when its current sub-goal matches that tactic and the target platform is one of: Android, iOS.

## Mitigations
- **M1011 User Guidance** - Describes any guidance or training given to users to set particular configuration settings or avoid specific potentially risky behaviors.
- **M1006 Use Recent OS Version** - New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques.
- **M1012 Enterprise Policy** - An enterprise mobility management (EMM), also known as mobile device management (MDM), system can be used to provision policies to mobile devices to control aspects of their allowed behavior.
