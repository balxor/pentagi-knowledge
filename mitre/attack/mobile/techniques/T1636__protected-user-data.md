# T1636 - Protected User Data

**Tactic(s):** Collection  -  **Platforms:** Android, iOS  -  **ATT&CK:** [T1636](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636)

## Summary
Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to collect data from permission-backed data stores on a device, such as the calendar or contact list. These permissions need to be declared ahead of time. On Android, they must be included in the application’s manifest. On iOS, they must be included in the application’s `Info.plist` file.  

 

In almost all cases, the user is required to grant access to the data store that the application is trying to access. In recent OS versions, vendors have introduced additional privacy controls for users, such as the ability to grant permission to an application only while the application is being actively used by the user. 

 

If the device has been jailbroken or rooted, an adversary may be able to access [Protected User Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636) without the user’s knowledge or approval.

## Role in the attack flow
Used to achieve the **Collection** objective. An autonomous agent invokes this when its current sub-goal matches that tactic and the target platform is one of: Android, iOS.

## Mitigations
- **M1006 Use Recent OS Version** - New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques.
- **M1011 User Guidance** - Describes any guidance or training given to users to set particular configuration settings or avoid specific potentially risky behaviors.
