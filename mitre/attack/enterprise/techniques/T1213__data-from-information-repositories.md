# T1213 - Data from Information Repositories

**Tactic(s):** Collection  ·  **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS, SaaS, IaaS, Office Suite  ·  **ATT&CK:** [T1213](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213)

## Summary
Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information. Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, such as Credential Access, Lateral Movement, or Defense Evasion, or direct access to the target information. Adversaries may also abuse external sharing features to share sensitive documents with recipients outside of the organization (i.e., [Transfer Data to Cloud Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1537)). 

The following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on an information repository:

* Policies, procedures, and standards
* Physical / logical network diagrams
* System architecture diagrams
* Technical system documentation
* Testing / development credentials (i.e., [Unsecured Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552)) 
* Work / project schedules
* Source code snippets
* Links to network shares and other internal resources
* Contact or other sensitive information about business partners and customers, including personally identifiable information (PII) 

Information stored in a repository may vary based on the specific instance or environment. Specific common information repositories include the following:

* Storage services such as IaaS databases, enterprise databases, and more specialized platforms such as customer relationship management (CRM) databases 
* Collaboration platforms such as SharePoint, Confluence, and code repositories
* Messaging platforms such as Slack and Microsoft Teams 

In some cases, information repositories have been improperly secured, typically by unintentionally allowing for overly-broad access by all users or even public access to unauthenticated users. This is particularly common with cloud-native or cloud-hosted services, such as AWS Relational Database Service (RDS), Redis, or ElasticSearch.(Citation: Mitiga)(Citation: TrendMicro Exposed Redis 2020)(Citation: Cybernews Reuters Leak 2022)

## Role in the attack flow
Used to achieve the **Collection** objective. An autonomous agent invokes this when its current sub-goal matches that tactic and the target platform is one of: Linux, Windows, macOS, SaaS, IaaS, Office Suite.

## Mitigations
- **M1032 Multi-factor Authentication** - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring users to provide at least two forms of verification to prove their identity before granting access. These factors typically include:
- **M1060 Out-of-Band Communications Channel** - Establish secure out-of-band communication channels to ensure the continuity of critical communications during security incidents, data integrity attacks, or in-network communication failures. Out-of-band communication refers to using an alternative, separate communication path that is not dependent on the potentially compromised primary network infrastructure. This method can include secure messaging apps, encrypted phone lines, satellite communications, or dedicated emergency communication systems. Leveraging these alternative channels reduces the risk of adversaries intercepting, disrupting, or tampering with sensitive communications and helps coordinate an effective incident response.(Citation: TrustedSec OOB Communications)(Citation: NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5)
- **M1017 User Training** - User Training involves educating employees and contractors on recognizing, reporting, and preventing cyber threats that rely on human interaction, such as phishing, social engineering, and other manipulative techniques. Comprehensive training programs create a human firewall by empowering users to be an active component of the organization's cybersecurity defenses. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:
- **M1054 Software Configuration** - Software configuration refers to making security-focused adjustments to the settings of applications, middleware, databases, or other software to mitigate potential threats. These changes help reduce the attack surface, enforce best practices, and protect sensitive data. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:
- **M1018 User Account Management** - User Account Management involves implementing and enforcing policies for the lifecycle of user accounts, including creation, modification, and deactivation. Proper account management reduces the attack surface by limiting unauthorized access, managing account privileges, and ensuring accounts are used according to organizational policies. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:
- **M1047 Audit** - Auditing is the process of recording activity and systematically reviewing and analyzing the activity and system configurations. The primary purpose of auditing is to detect anomalies and identify potential threats or weaknesses in the environment. Proper auditing configurations can also help to meet compliance requirements. The process of auditing encompasses regular analysis of user behaviors and system logs in support of proactive security measures.
- **M1041 Encrypt Sensitive Information** - Protect sensitive information at rest, in transit, and during processing by using strong encryption algorithms. Encryption ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data, preventing unauthorized access or tampering. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:
