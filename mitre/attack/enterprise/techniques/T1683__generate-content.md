# T1683 - Generate Content

**Tactic(s):** Resource Development  -  **Platforms:** PRE  -  **ATT&CK:** [T1683](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1683)

## Summary
Adversaries may create or generate content to support targeting and operations. This content may be used to establish personas, impersonate known individuals or organizations, and support [Social Engineering](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1684), fraud, or influence activities. Written materials, audio, images, video, or other media may be developed and tailored to the target and objective.(Citation: IBM AI-Generated Content)

Content development may occur prior to or during an operation. Adversaries may develop or generate content in-house, source it through third parties, or produce it using AI-assisted tools. Adversaries may use AI to research targets, develop pretexts, and better understand the organizations and individuals they intend to target or deceive prior to generating content (i.e., [Query Public AI Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1682)); for obtaining access to AI tools used in content generation, see [Artificial Intelligence](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/007). 

Content may be leveraged in support of techniques such as [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566), [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598), [Social Engineering](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1684), [Financial Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1657), or [Establish Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585). Generated or developed content does not include malicious code or scripts (i.e., [Develop Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587) and [Artificial Intelligence](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/007)).

## Role in the attack flow
Used to achieve the **Resource Development** objective. An autonomous agent invokes this when its current sub-goal matches that tactic and the target platform is one of: PRE.

## Mitigations
- **M1056 Pre-compromise** - Pre-compromise mitigations involve proactive measures and defenses implemented to prevent adversaries from successfully identifying and exploiting weaknesses during the Reconnaissance and Resource Development phases of an attack. These activities focus on reducing an organization's attack surface, identify adversarial preparation efforts, and increase the difficulty for attackers to conduct successful operations. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:
